# Carz App

A simple project for fulfilling requirement for
[Finology Group](https://finology-group.com/) recruitment as a Frontend Engineer

- Currently the only working features is Home and Cars page. 
- The car list and the image may be different because I don't find any free API services that provide Cars information with images.
- The car list page is already a dynamic feature, which is doing a fetch API process.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
